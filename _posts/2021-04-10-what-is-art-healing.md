## Introduction


In fact, art has had a healing function since ancient times. As archaeologists discover and gather more evidence and new sites, Neanderthals created various shapes and sizes of markings on the walls of caves - this is the earliest form of art.

According to Packard, humans during this period may have begun using art to psychologically prepare hunters for their long and dangerous hunting expeditions. These cave paintings depicted the fears, hopes, and desires of hunters, and were symbolically offered to their gods.

As one of the most developed countries in art therapy, the art therapy industry in the United States has a history of over 80 years. In recent years, universities have gradually incorporated "art therapy" into their discipline and professional scope, as well as the development of "humanistic art therapy" in China. Art therapy has become a truly emerging treatment technology in China. 

By definition, art therapy is an auxiliary form of psychotherapy that differs from language communication in conventional psychotherapy. It uses creative forms to analyze and explore individual problems through artistic creation. Simply put, it is a way to vent emotions and heal oneself through watching or creating. The art therapy profession spans both art and psychology majors, and the presentation of works is mainly in the form of visual art, manifested in performing arts such as illustration, installation, interactive media, dance, drama, etc. Translate the above paragraph into English
